    <br> <br> <br> <h1> ONLINE THEORETICAL DRIVING COURSE </h1> <br>
    <p>This 15hr-course has been required since 2020 in order to acquire a student permit here in the Philippines.  </p>
    <p>This was LTO's solution to fix and resolve traffic issues here in the Philippines. </p>
    <p>This course will also give the students a better understanding on how to stay safe on the road, develop a better driving attitude, </p>
    <p>better understanding of road signs, and develop a clearer driver intuition. </p><br>
    <p>At the end of the course, a completion certificate will be given to the student. </p>
